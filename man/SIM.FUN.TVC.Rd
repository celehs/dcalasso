\title{Generate simulation data to test time-dependent Cox model with adaptive lasso}
\usage{
SIM.FUN.TVC(p.ti = 50, p.tv = 50, n.subject = 1e+06, cor = 0.2,
  beta0.ti = NULL, beta0.tv = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p.ti}{number of time-invariant covariates}

\item{p.tv}{number of time-varying covariates}

\item{n.subject}{number of subjects}

\item{cor}{correlation between time-varying and each interval's time-varying covairates}

\item{beta0.ti}{coefficient for time-invariant covariates}

\item{beta0.tv}{coefficients for time-varying covariates}
}
\value{
a matrix with the first column starting time, second column ending time, third column event (0,1), and rest = design matrix + ID for subject.
}
\description{
\code{SIM.FUN.TVC} generates time-dependent survival response with four time-intervals 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 for each subject data. All subjects are administratively censored at 4, if T>4. T comes from a Weibull distribution with shape of 2.
The design matrix comes from a correlated multivariate normal. The default signals (beta0) are sparse.
